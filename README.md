## Which Podcaster
This project contains three neural networks that can determine which host of the Danish podcast _Her GÃ¥r Det Godt_ - Esbjen, Peter or both - from labeled 5 second clips.

## Motivation
This project was completed as part of the Deep Neural Networks class in the fall of 2021 at the University of Southern Denmark.

## Features
This project contains 3 different model architectures, each of which are able to learn to correctly label all of the given dataset.
We also developed a caption creating pipeline to test our models on external data, which writes which of the hosts is speaking on each frame of a video.

## How to use?
To train a model execute the main.py script where you can change some hyperparameters to adjust the performance. It is possible to split the 5 second clips into smaller files to test if the networks can perform classification at a higher rate. To this execute data_splitter.py where the chunk length can be adjusted as desired. To create subtitles an audio track must be imported and split using data_splitter.py, next the text file save must be uncommented in main.py under execute testto produce a text file containing the predictions. The captions can then be added by executing Subtitlewritter.py with the appropriate updated file paths for the predictions and the video. The audio must then be added back using a third party video editing software or by other means.
