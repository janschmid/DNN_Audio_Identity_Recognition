## Which Podcaster
This project contains three neural networks that can determine which host of the Danish podcast _Her GÃ¥r Det Godt_ - Esbjen, Peter or both - from labeled 5 second clips.

## Motivation
This project was completed as part of the Deep Neural Networks class in the fall of 2021 at the University of Southern Denmark.

## Features
This project contains 3 different model architectures, each of which are able to learn to correctly label all of the given dataset.
We also developed a caption creating pipeline to test our models on external data, which writes which of the hosts is speaking on each frame of a video.

## How to use?
To train a model execute the main.py script where you can change some hyperparameters to adjust the performance. It is possible to split the 5 second clips into smaller files to test if the networks can perform classification at a higher rate. To this execute data_splitter.py where the chunk length can be adjusted as desired. To create subtitles the text file save must be uncommented in main.py under execute test and a text file will be saved with the predictions. The captions can then be added by executing subtitlewritter.py with the appropriate file paths.
